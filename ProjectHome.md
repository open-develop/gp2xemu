System-wide emulation of the MagicEyes MMSP2 chip and additional peripherals found on the GP2X F-100 handheld. Other emulators like QEMU and SkyEye can emulate the same architecture, but does not emulate the exact hardware found on this handheld. This project aims to do that.
The goal is to make an accurate emulator which can aid in debugging and development. Ease-of-use and accuracy will have priority over performance.
The GP2X supports DRM in order to protect commercial games/applications. DRM support is not planned due to legal issues.
