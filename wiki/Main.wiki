= Introduction =
Gp2xemu is an emulator    which emulates the [http://www.gp2x.co.uk gp2x] handheld device.
----
The goal is to be able to boot a working bootloader and OS. By emulating an RS-232 port via the EXT port, one can get visual feedback without audio and graphics. Audio and graphics will be added at the end of the development cycle, if *at all*. This emulator isn't made with gaming in mind, but to aid developers in debugging firmware.
